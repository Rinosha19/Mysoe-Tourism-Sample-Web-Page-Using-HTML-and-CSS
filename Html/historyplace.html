        <p>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence (house). It is
            located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the
            seat of the Kingdom of Mysore.The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward.
            Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of the Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one.
            However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.</p><br>
        <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). The first
            palace inside the Old Fort was built in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple
            times.The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone,
            bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt
            down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Palace is one of the most famous tourist
            attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors.</p>
