        <p>The Chamundeshwari Celebrity Wax Museum is the brainchild of Umesh Shetty who is a renowned sculptor from Honnavar in Uttar Kannada. It is situated near the City Armed Reserve Parade Grounds in Mysore. A team of 10-12 people worked along with the artist Umesh Shetty for almost two years to make this wax museum a reality.</p> <br>
        <p>This museum is first of its kind in Karnataka and has life-size wax effigies of a number of celebrities from around the world. The list of celebrities includes actors, politicians, spiritual leaders, sports personalities, scientists and mathematicians. </p><br>   
        <p>Kalpana Chawla, Mahatma Gandhi, APJ Abdul Kalam, Rajnikanth, Lionel Messi, Mona Lisa, Charlie Chaplain, Mother Teresa, and Albert Einstein are some of the popular figures that you get to see in this wax museum.
        <br><p>These wax figures are too perfect in creation that they look alive and real. This museum has over fifty celebrity wax sculptures and they are planning to add a few more including that of Tipu Sultan, Virat Kholi, Kuvempu, and Shilpa Shetty.
